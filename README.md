#Globally robust confidence intervals for simple linear regression models

`R` code to compute
globally robust confidence intervals for the slope of a simple linear regression model 
as proposed in 
[Adrover, J. and Salibian-Barrera, M. (2010)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.csda.2009.05.005).

The functions are in the file `rci-pub.R`. A simple illustration is in the script `rci-example.R`.
